## 🚀 Critical path to first Play Store submission

Work through these in order:

1. **Generate keystore** → [keystore-setup.md](./keystore-setup.md)
2. **Build signed AAB** → [release-build-guide.md](./release-build-guide.md)
3. **Test on real device** → [manual-smoke-test.md](./manual-smoke-test.md)
4. **Produce visual assets** → [app-assets-guide.md](./app-assets-guide.md)
5. **Host Privacy + Terms URLs** → [privacy-policy.md](./privacy-policy.md) + [terms-of-service.md](./terms-of-service.md)
6. **Set up Play Console account** → [play-console-setup.md](./play-console-setup.md) (Parts 1–2)
7. **Fill Data Safety form** → [data-safety-form.md](./data-safety-form.md)

## 🔁 Continuous (do every release)

- Bump `version:` in `pubspec.yaml` (marketing version and monotonic build number)
- Build signed AAB
- Run manual smoke test on a real device
- Upload to Internal testing first
- Review pre-launch report
- Monitor Crashlytics for 24h before promoting to Production
- Update "What's New" in [store-listing.md](./store-listing.md)
