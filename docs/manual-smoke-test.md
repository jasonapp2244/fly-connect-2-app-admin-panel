# Manual Smoke Test — Android

**Purpose:** verify that a signed release build works end-to-end on a real Android device before promoting to any testing track.

**Prerequisites:**
- Signed release AAB/APK installed on device (see `docs/release-build-guide.md`)
- Physical Android phone (Pixel or equivalent) with Android 13 or higher
- Wi-Fi connection
- Test account credentials:
  - Crew: `alex@delta.com` / `Test1234!`
  - Business: `info@skyloungelnyc.com` / `Test1234!`
  - Admin: `alan123@gmail.com` / `Admin@1234`

**How to use:** work through each section in order. Check the box on pass. If any step fails, stop, log the issue, do not promote the build.
